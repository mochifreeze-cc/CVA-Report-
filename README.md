# CVA Report – Stroke Risk Data Analysis
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis of a healthcare dataset related to stroke (CVA) risk factors.
The goal is to identify patterns and relationships between demographic, clinical, and lifestyle variables that may contribute to stroke occurrence, using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques.

The analysis was developed as an academic project to strengthen skills in data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation using real-world data.

# Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized patient information, including:

Age

Gender

Hypertension

Heart disease

Average glucose level

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Smoking status

Stroke occurrence (target variable)

The data was explored to compare patterns between individuals with and without a history of stroke.

# Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Git & GitHub

Analysis Process

# The project followed a structured data analysis workflow:

Data loading and inspection

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Handling missing values

Formatting and transforming variables

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis of key variables

Comparison between stroke and non-stroke groups

Data visualization

Charts to highlight trends and differences

Insight extraction

Identification of relevant risk factors

# Key Insights

Age shows a strong relationship with stroke occurrence, with higher incidence among older individuals.

Individuals with hypertension or heart disease appear more frequently in the stroke group.

Higher average glucose levels and BMI values are associated with increased stroke risk.

Visual comparisons clearly highlight differences in health indicators between patients with and without stroke history.

These insights demonstrate how data exploration and visualization can support understanding of healthcare risk factors.
